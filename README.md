Program Description: I am creating a music playlist using the
doubly linked data structure. By using a doubly linked data structure, I can
connect all the songs to a respective place, thus it makes an order/list. 

Features: In my music playlist, I have a Song class that creates all the
Song attributes. It connects a song to another song. In MyPlayList class, we
specify the functionalities of what a music player can do such as adding,
removing, shuffling, reversing, clear songs and etc. In MyPlayListIterator, we
can access each song and go through all the songs in the playlist
